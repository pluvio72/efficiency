      "A linked list is a linear collection of elements in which each node has a value and points to the next node in the list or has the value of 'null' as it's pointer which means it is the end of the list. The main advantages of a linked list over an array is that you can insert/remove elements without having to relocate the rest of the list (doesn't store data in contiguous manner like an array).",
