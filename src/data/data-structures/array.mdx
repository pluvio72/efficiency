# Arrays

> An array is a linear data structure which stores a number of elements in a contiguous block of memory.

### Specifics:

- Individual elements are accessed with an integer index
- Can be of a fixed size or re-sizeable
- Usually store numbers but can store any data type

### Application:

- Since they are very versatile and simple they are used to construct more complex data structure such as stacks/queues/linked lists/trees.
- Construct matrices and tables
