# Hash Table

> A Hash table "Hash map" is an associative array (dictionary) which includes key-value pairs.

### Specifics:

- Each key is used in a hash function to compute an index which is then used to lookup the respective value
- Can create "hash collisions" where the has function generates the same index for more than one key.
  - Hash tables often implement imperfect hash functions which creates this problem.

### Application:

- Store cached web pages
- Used in cryptography to create digital signatures
- Implement database indexes
