# Linked List

> A linked list is a linear collection of nodes which together represent a sequence.

### Specifics:

- Each node has a value and points to the next node in the list or has the value of 'null' as it's pointer which means it is the end of the list
- It doesn't store data in contiguous manner like an array.

### Application:

- Handle collisions in hash tables
- Represent graphs
- Allocating/deallocating memory dynamically

There are multiple types of linked lists:

- Singly linked list
- Doubly linked list
- Circular linked list

#### Singly linked list

Each node has a value and reference to the next node

#### Doubly linked list

Each node has a value, reference to the next node and reference to the previous node (except the head node).

#### Circular linked list

Same as singly linked list except the tail node's next node reference instead of being null points to the head node again creating a circle.
